The application's main feature is Timetable for students and teachers. Students or teachers can get their timetable for a day or a month.

The learning process manager can edit the schedule by the use of the "Substitute teacher" feature. This allows replacing a certain teacher with another one who is available for the selected period and can lecture the same course.

It's also possible to edit lists of students, groups, teachers, rooms, courses, and lectures.
